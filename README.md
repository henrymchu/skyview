## Overview
This project is a simple frontend personal finance application built with React.js. It serves as a demonstration of my skills in developing user interfaces with React, including component structuring, state management, and basic routing. While the application is non-functioning in terms of backend integration or complete feature implementation, it showcases the potential structure and design of a fully functional application.

### Features

- **Component Design**: Demonstrates the use of functional components and class components (if applicable).

- **State Management**: Examples of using React's useState hook for state management within components.

- **Routing**: Utilizes React Router for navigating between different pages/views (if applicable).

- **Styling**: Shows styling approaches using CSS Modules or styled-components (whichever is used).
